# TextBasedGame-Invader
This is a project done for IT-140 at SNHU, week/MOD 7.

Objective of the game is to have a starting room with no item, an ending room with the villain, and 6 rooms with items in them.
You win the game if you reach the villain room with all 6 items, otherwise you lose.

You may quit the game at any time, using the appropriate input. The game will not close at the end until you input any character and
press enter.

Included:
Dictionary containing all of the rooms, the directions you can go from them, and what items they contain.
The main() function, used to run the actual gameplay loops.
Exit/quit input, to stop the game from running.
Inventory that takes the item from the room so you cannot grab the same item twice.
User input validation.
